And every single lyric to "Style" by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1]<br/>
Midnight <br/>
You come and pick me up, no headlights<br/>
A long drive<br/>
Could end in burning flames or paradise<br/>
Fade into view, oh<br/>
It's been a while since I have even heard from you<br/>
(Heard from you)<br/>

[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I<br/>
Know exactly where it leads, but I<br/>
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time<br/>

[Chorus]<br/>
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br/>
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br/>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br/>
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br/>
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt<br/>
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt<br/>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br/>
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br/>

[Verse 2]<br/>
So it goes<br/>
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm<br/>
Takes me home<br/>
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mmm, yeah<br/>
I say, "I heard, oh<br/>
That you've been out and about with some other girl"<br/>
Some other girl<br/>

[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
He says, "What you heard is true, but I<br/>
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"<br/>
I said, "I've been there too a few times"<br/>

[Chorus]<br/>
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br/>
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br/><br/>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br/>
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt<br/>
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)<br/>
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time<br/>
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go), we never go out of style<br/>

[Bridge]<br/>
Take me home (Ah)<br/>
Just take me home (Ah)<br/>
Yeah, just take me home (Ah)<br/>
Oh-oh, woah-oh, oh (Out of style)<br/>

[Chorus]<br/>
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye<br/>
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br/>
And when we go crashing down (And when we go), we come back every time<br/>
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style<br/>
